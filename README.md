# dtd

a simple web server for self-hosting java enterprise document type definitions (DTDs).
this was especially useful during the transition from oracle to the eclipse foundation, when no one seemed to take responsibility for providing a permanent source for these files.
after the third relocation, i decided to host this myself.
